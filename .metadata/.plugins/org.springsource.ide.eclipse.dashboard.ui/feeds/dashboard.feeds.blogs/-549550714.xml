As a result, security is sometimes inconsistent, and can be seen as a barrier to moving applications to the cloud. The session will examine the security of a typical Java Web application in an enterprise deployment. We will then look at what needs to change when that secure Java application is “forklifted” into Cloud Foundry. Finally, we will look at the benefits of adopting cloud native security protocols, such as OAuth2 and SAML2. The journey will cover 5 common application security architecture patterns taken from real world customer problems. We will compare how the security integration patterns differ between a standalone application and a cloud native application. From legacy enterprise identity management integration to security for microservices, this technical session includes practical, hands-on guidance to properly implementing authentication, authorization, and confidentiality controls using Spring and Cloud Foundry. We have all heard of the idea of the “Full Stack” developer — someone who can understand the application up and down the whole stack. The goal of this session is to describe the full security stack and show how it differs between standalone deployments and a PAAS deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIyJBoq8cBc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

However, this is only one of the many features of Spring Boot. One of its module also provides many important Non-Functional Requirements out-of-the-box: monitoring, metrics, exposing those over HTTP, etc. In this presentation, I&amp;rsquo;ll demo some of those, that will make DevOps more than a little happy.&lt;br/&gt;Comments: DevOps that don&amp;rsquo;t know about Spring Boot should.

One of the most well known descriptions of these new paradigms is the Twelve Factor App (12factor.net), which describes elements of cloud native applications. Many of these needs are squarely met through the Spring Framework, others require support from other systems. In this session we will examine each of the twelve factors and present how Spring, and platforms such as Cloud Foundry satisfy them, and in some cases we’ll even suggest that responsibility should shift from Spring to platforms. At the conclusion you will understand what is needed for cloud-native applications, why and how to deliver on those requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-BDwknHzn4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Lattice includes features like:&lt;br/&gt;Cluster scheduling&lt;br/&gt;HTTP load balancing&lt;br/&gt;Log aggregation&lt;br/&gt;Health management&lt;br/&gt;Lattice does this by packaging a subset of the components found in the Cloud Foundry elastic runtime. The result is an open, single-tenant environment suitable for rapid application development, similar to Kubernetes and Mesos Applications developed using Lattice should migrate unchanged to full Cloud Foundry deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lattice can be used by Spring developers to spin up powerful micro-cloud environments on their desktops, and can be useful for developing and testing cloud-native application architectures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud 1.0 is here! It offers a powerful way to create and consume microservices. As you introduce new services, you introduce integration problems: services can be shaky, they can disappear and - as they&amp;rsquo;re often exposed over HTTP - they require a bit more footwork than in-process method invocations. In this webinar, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus specifically on how Spring Cloud integrates service registration (e.g. Eureka), declarative REST clients (with Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Feign), reactive programming and the circuit breaker pattern with Hystrix to support easy, robust service-to-service invocations, and messaging microservices with Spring Cloud Stream. This is a deep dive on how to make connect and consume microservices, and is a natural next step after the introduction to building microservices with Spring Boot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCEvFDhe3os" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

We will start with bootstrapping with Yeoman, move into managing dependencies with bower, and finally how to automate best practices with Grunt and Gulp. We will discuss the pros and cons of modern ui toolkits like Zurb, Bootstrap, and SemanticUI and modern javascript frameworks like React, Angular, and Ember. We will highlight the latest in css frameworks, javascript frameworks, and why you should choose the right toolset for complex app or a single page app. When you leave this session you will be prepared to launch a modern web application in 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-uA4a8y8q9I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 years in the making and finally JSR-107 has been finalized. We now have a standardized Caching API for the Java Platform. And that&amp;rsquo;s all ready for you to use in your Spring apps. But what does it really enable for you? What&amp;rsquo;s with these optional features? No transaction support? How do you efficiently make use of this new API to solve real world problems in your application today? We&amp;rsquo;ll look into how get you best started introducing caching into your Spring application to solve real world problems. And, as we explore the javax.cache API in much more details, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to push the specifications to its limits and&amp;hellip; beyond. Whether implicitly through frameworks (like Spring and Hibernate), or explicitly (cache-aside, cache-through, &amp;hellip;). And how to abstract yourself from a given provider when you require more than what the specifications cover (e.g. transactional caches). We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover some implementer specifics you might want to account for when choosing an implementation, especially if you plan to push the spec to the extreme, like when going distributed and caching terabytes of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CsaOK1GPj-E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grails 3 includes a lot of features and functionality related to building RESTful services. These include an entirely new and more flexibile data binding system, runtime and compile time metaprogramming which greatly reduce the amount of code required in your RESTful services, a rich set of content negotiation tools and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LVNJza4NO5U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

More and more often Grails is showing up in microservice architectures where instead of building 1 monolithing web application which is responsible for all of the pieces of the application puzzle, microservice applications are being assembled which collectively solve the requirements of the larger application. Grails is very well suited for this type of architecture. A microservice based architecture can result in applications which are easier to build, easier to test, easier to extend and are easier to adapt to changing business requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxukqBZmWsM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Speakers: Jon Schneider, Taylor Wicksell - Netflix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web / JavaScript Track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Slides: &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-cloud-at-netflix"&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-cloud-at-netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Native Track&lt;br/&gt;Spring Cloud Netflix allows you to quickly take your existing Spring Boot application and transform it into a fully cloud-ready service (even if you are operating out of a private data center).&lt;br/&gt;This talk will be largely live coded, taking a simple Spring Boot app and progressively augmenting it with more and more production-ready features.&lt;br/&gt;1. Service discovery &amp;ndash; how we have extended Spring Cloud to integrate more seamlessly with Eureka.&lt;br/&gt;2. Real-time Metrics &amp;ndash; Spectator/Atlas integration, including how we fold Spring Boot Actuator metrics into Spectator. We will show you how to use the Atlas stack language to generate real-time metrics graphics.&lt;br/&gt;3. Inter-service Communication/Loading Balancing - When should you choose client-side load balancing (Ribbon) over traditional server-side load balancing? We will explain how Netflix OSS can contain both a client side load balancer in Ribbon and a software router in Zuul and when to use each.&lt;br/&gt;4. Managing Failure - Provide a demo of Hystrix/Spring integration with Turbine.&lt;br/&gt;5. Analytics - How Spring Cloud Netflix makes Spring XD an even more powerful real-time analytics platform with real-time operational insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6wvVANQ6EJ8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
